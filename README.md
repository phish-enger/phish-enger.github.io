# phish-enger (Messenger Phishing sample site)
For educational purposes only. This is a phishing site based from Messenger's log in page. This is made for our Digital Forensics activity on phishing emails.

# I logged in to your sample phishing site by accident, or someone used it to phish it from me. What do I do?
Don't worry. The script only prints it out on the console of your browser's JavaScript engine, instead of storing it in a separate local file. This is because this is only done for educational purposes to demonstrate a malicious user stealing information via a fake login page of a legitimate site. If you've somehow managed to get tricked by this through someone else, please report that user.

# Will this be removed?
Yes. Once our instructor has checked out the site and gave it a grade, I'll remove this repo and the site at instant. (Please remind me btw, github mods, if i forgot. man, college is really making my brain go eepy and tired aaaaaa)
